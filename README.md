Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Enginnering is a part of computer science that is involved in the  process of designing, developing, testing, delivering and maintaining useful software apps/ systems.
**IMPORTACE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING**
1. To improve software quality and improve productivity.
2. Software automates repetitive tasks saving organizations time and reduces human errors.
3. Software solutions like websites and mobile apps make it easier for clients and users to access services esaily, enhancing customer experience.
4. Software enables for data management and analysis for informed decision making.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Mastering complexity - The rise of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), introduced modularity and reusability to manage complex systems.
2. Mastering process - Agile manifesto and Agile development, this enables iterative , adoptive and collaborative software development.
3. Mastering machine - Cloud computing, provided scalable on-demand infrastructure for modern applications.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Specification - What a system should do an it's devlopment constraints.
2. Design - Production of the software system, the coding.
3. Validation - Checking the software is what the customer wants.
4. Implementation - Launching/ Releasing the system/app to the consumer. 
5. Evolution/Maintenance  - Changing the software in response to changing demands. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Comparison Table**
Aspect;
1. Approach; While Waterfall is linear and sequential. Agile is iterative and incremental.
2. Flexibility;	waterfall, is rigid changes are difficult to accommodate. Agile is Flexible, changes are welcomed.
3. Documentation; while	waterfall has extensive documentation at each phase.	Agile has Minimal documentation; focus on working software.
4. Stakeholder Involvement; in waterfall it is	limited to the beginning and end of the process. Agile has	continuous involvement throughout the project.
5. In waterfall testing	occurs at the end of the project.	Agile has continuous testing throughout the project.
6. Risk Management;	For waterfall risks are addressed late in the process while in Agile risks are identified and mitigated early.
7. Delivery; In waterfall	there is a single delivery at the end of the project while in Agile	there are frequent deliveries at the end of each sprint.
8. Waterfall is best For	Projects with fixed requirements and scope while in Agile projects with evolving requirements and scope.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
**Roles of a software Development**
1. Design and developing software architecture and write clean, efficient code/ applications for IOS, android, windows etc and implementing features and functionalities based on project requirements.
2. Conducting an analysis of requirements by collaborating with stakeholders to understand project requirements and tweaking as needed.
3. Releasing software updates as part of maintence.
4. Preparing the documentation necessary for other programmers to write the code.
**Roles of a Quality Assurance Engineer**
1. Ensure that software adheres to the highest standards so that it meets user expectations.
2. Reduce costs by identifying issues and having them adressed properly.
3. Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and protects against security breaches.
4. Develop test plans and strategies based on project requirements.
5. Generate test reports and metrics to track quality and progress.
**Roles of a project manager**
1. Project Planning by defining project scope, goals, and deliverables.
2. Resource Management through the allocation of resources such as team members, tools, budget etc effectively.
3. Risk Management by identifying potential risks and develop mitigation plans.
4. Communication by acting as the primary point of contact for stakeholders.
5. Progress Tracking by monitoring project progress using tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana.
6. Team Leadership through motivating and support the team to achieve project goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
