List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Specification - What a system should do an it's devlopment constraints.
2. Design - Production of the software system, the coding.
3. Validation - Checking the software is what the customer wants.
4. Implementation - Launching/ Releasing the system/app to the consumer. 
5. Evolution/Maintenance  - Changing the software in response to changing demands. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Comparison Table**
Aspect;
1. Approach; While Waterfall is linear and sequential. Agile is iterative and incremental.
2. Flexibility;	waterfall, is rigid changes are difficult to accommodate. Agile is Flexible, changes are welcomed.
3. Documentation; while	waterfall has extensive documentation at each phase.	Agile has Minimal documentation; focus on working software.
4. Stakeholder Involvement; in waterfall it is	limited to the beginning and end of the process. Agile has	continuous involvement throughout the project.
5. In waterfall testing	occurs at the end of the project.	Agile has continuous testing throughout the project.
6. Risk Management;	For waterfall risks are addressed late in the process while in Agile risks are identified and mitigated early.
7. Delivery; In waterfall	there is a single delivery at the end of the project while in Agile	there are frequent deliveries at the end of each sprint.
8. Waterfall is best For	Projects with fixed requirements and scope while in Agile projects with evolving requirements and scope.

6. Team Leadership through motivating and support the team to achieve project goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**
An IDE is a software appl that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. It typically includes a code editor, debugger, compiler, and other tools in a single interface.
**Importance of IDEs**
1. IDEs provide advanced code editors with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and code formatting, making it easier to write and read code.
Example: Visual Studio Code highlights syntax errors and suggests code completions in real-time.
2. IDEs include built-in debuggers that allow developers to step through code, inspect variables, and identify issues.
Example: PyCharm’s debugger helps Python developers identify and fix bugs efficiently.
3. IDEs automate the process of building and compiling code, reducing manual effort and errors.
Example: Eclipse automatically compiles Java code and highlights compilation errors.
4. IDEs provide tools for managing project files, dependencies, and configurations in one place.
Example: IntelliJ IDEA organizes Java projects with modules, libraries, and build configurations.
5. IDEs support plugins and extensions to enhance functionality, such as integrating with version control systems or adding support for new programming languages.
Example: Visual Studio Code’s extensions for Git integration, linting, and language support.
**Examples of IDEs**
Visual Studio Code: A lightweight, extensible IDE for multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.).
**Version Control Sytem**
A VCS is a tool that tracks changes to code over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It enables versioning, branching, and merging of code.
**Importance of VCS**
1. VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.
2. Tracks changes to code, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
3. Supports branching, enabling developers to work on new features or fixes independently. Changes can later be merged into the main codebase.
4. VCS facilitates code reviews by tracking who made changes and when. This improves code quality and accountability.
5. VCS acts as a backup of the codebase, ensuring that code is not lost even if local copies are damaged or deleted.
**Examples of VCS**
Git: The most widely used distributed version control system.
GitHub: A platform for hosting Git repositories with collaboration features like pull requests and code reviews.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
**Challenges;**
1. Stakeholders often change or add requirements during the project, leading to scope creep and delays.
2. Tight and unrealistic deadlines can lead to rushed work, technical debt, and burnout.
3. Accumulation of quick fixes and shortcuts can lead to a fragile codebase that is difficult to maintain.
4. Communication gaps and miscommunication between team members, stakeholders, or departments can lead to misunderstandings and errors.
5. Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for requirements, designs, and processes and use collaboration Tools: Use tools like Slack
**Strategies;**
1. Using Agile Methodologyto accommodate changes through iterative development and regular feedback.
2. Maintain open communication with stakeholders to manage expectations and prioritize requirements.
3. Realistic Planning by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and setting achievable milestones. Focus on high-priority features and defer less critical tasks to later phases and use tools like Gantt charts to manage time effectively.
4. Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices and automated testing.
5. Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for requirements, designs, and processes and use collaboration Tools: Use tools like Slack.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
**Unit Testing**
Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code (e.g., functions, methods, or classes) in isolation. To verify that each unit of the software performs as expected.
**Intergration Testing**
Integration testing checks how different units or modules of the software work together. Ensures that integrated components function correctly as a group.
**System Testing**
System testing evaluates the complete, integrated system to ensure it meets specified requirements. To validate the system’s functionality, performance, and reliability as a whole.
**Acceptance Testing**
 Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the software is ready for delivery and meets the stakeholders’ requirements. To ensure the software is acceptable for deployment and use.
   **Importance of Testing in Software Quality Assurance**
1. Defect Detection: Identifies and fixes bugs early, reducing the cost of fixing them later.
2. Quality Assurance: Ensures the software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
3. User Satisfaction: Delivers a reliable, high-quality product that meets user expectations.
4. Risk Mitigation: Reduces the risk of failures, security breaches, and performance issues.
5. Continuous Improvement: Provides feedback for improving development processes and practices.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective inputs to guide AI models in generating desired outputs.
 **Prompt Engineering**
1. Improves Output Quality. Example: Instead of asking, "Tell me about AI," a better prompt would be, "Explain the key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in artificial intelligence."
2. Enhances Efficiency - Effective prompts reduce the need for multiple iterations or follow-up questions, saving time and effort.
3. Enables Specificity - Prompts can be tailored to extract specific information or generate outputs in a desired format.
4. Reduces Ambiguity - Clear and detailed prompts minimize the risk of ambiguous or irrelevant responses.
5. Facilitates Complex Tasks - Prompt engineering enables AI models to perform complex tasks, such as coding, summarization, or creative writing, by breaking them into manageable steps.
6. Adapts to Different Use Cases - Prompts can be customized for various applications, such as customer support, content creation, or data analysis.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
**Vague Prompt**
"Tell me about AI."
**Improved Prompt**
"Explain the key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in artificial intelligence, and provide one real-world application for each."
